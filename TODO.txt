Additional roles and features needed before full feature parity exists with 1.0 Jenkins Master

- tasks/create_jenkins_task.py
  * _config_jenkins_backups
    Backups should probably be their own role

  * _config_job_priorities
    Make this part of the Jenkins jobs roles

  * _set_env_vars
    Set arbitrary environment variables through Groovy script - could be integrated to master role?

  * _create_jobs
    Creates the jobs based on external JJB
    Possibly needs more input on where job definitions will be loaded from

  * _configure_views
    Setup Jenkins UI views
